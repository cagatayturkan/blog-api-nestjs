While growth depends on market trends, this long-term outlook suggests steady gains if adoption continues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

Its price is influenced more by community interest and internet trends than technical upgrades, which makes it a high-risk, high-reward investment. Caution and research are strongly advised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4.

If the online community rallies again, another price spike is possible, but not guaranteed.\u003C/p\u003E"

We can see them appear many times during bull markets or bear markets, where the price is moving consistently in one direction inside a channel.

There are three main types of triangle patterns you should be aware of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

Over time, the price forms higher lows as it pushes up toward the horizontal resistance. The price usually makes multiple attempts to break through the upper resistance line and gets rejected. But eventually, after enough pressure builds up, it breaks through that line and often results in a strong upward breakout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Descending Triangle\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe descending triangle is the opposite. The top line is sloping downwards, and the bottom line is flat, forming a support zone. In this pattern, the price makes lower highs and eventually gets squeezed into a tighter range. Once the price breaks below the support zone, it often leads to a strong downward move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

The upper line goes down, and the lower line goes up, so the price gets squeezed more and more. Eventually, the price breaks out of the triangle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreakouts from symmetrical triangles can happen in either direction. However, it's statistically a bit more likely that the breakout will occur in the same direction that the price was moving before entering the triangle.\u003C/p\u003E"

On the daily chart, this moving average can help you identify the general trend.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the price is above the 200-day moving average, we are likely in an uptrend.

Historically, this line has been a very good indicator of market bottoms during bear markets. We can see several instances in crypto history where the price touched this line and then bounced up, marking the start of a bull market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might wonder how this moving average is calculated. In this case, on the weekly chart, the 200-period moving average takes the last 200 weekly candles and calculates their average closing price. That’s why the line appears so smooth and doesn't react sharply to sudden spikes.\u003C/p\u003E"

The RSI shows whether the market is overbought or oversold. For example, when the RSI spikes too much to the top, it’s usually a pretty good indicator that the market is overheated, and a downward correction may follow. The same logic applies when the RSI dips too far down, it signals that the market is oversold and might bounce back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that while RSI is not 100% accurate, it’s a very helpful tool in identifying potential tops and bottoms, especially when combined with other indicators. You can also use RSI on different time frames.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, on the 4-hour chart, it can help you find short-term overbought or oversold conditions. If the RSI is high, it’s more likely that we’ll see a pullback. If it’s low, we might be close to a local bottom. This flexibility makes RSI useful for both day traders and long-term investors alike.\u003C/p\u003E"
